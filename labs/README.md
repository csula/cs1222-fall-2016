# General Instruction for Labs

For each lab, you will need to ensure your computer has MySQL server running and
start your MySQL client (either MySQL Cli, MySQL workbench or SequalPro).

Your job is to answer every questions on the laboratory notes.

For example, if the question asks you to list all Artists in Artists table, your
answer might be something like below:

```sql
# Question 1
SELECT * FROM Artists;
```

Furthermore, if the question asks general question where you have to answer it
in a paragraph. Write this paragraph in comments. E.g.

```sql
# Question 2:
# Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.
# Nisi, sunt! Alias incidunt hic, odit obcaecati, debitis beatae culpa
# molestiae ea pariatur minus fugiat rem consequuntur fuga cum. Ab repellendus, quasi!
```

In summary, your submission should be one `.sql` file and nothing else. And
your comment in SQL file should provide enough context for grader to grade.
